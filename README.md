- My game is a VERY simple nature based obby, inclcluding navigating (I uswe that word lighly) a forest, jumping between moving mushrooms, and balancing on logs.

- I changed the height of the player to make the POV feel a little more natural, and adjusted the jump force and gravity for more realistic jumping. I also increased the characters speed.
